<p>Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is a Lego-themed action-adventure video game based on the Lego Star Wars line of construction toys. It is a combination of the game Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005) and its sequel, Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, in 2006, which span the first six episodes of the Skywalker Saga. The game was announced by LucasArts on 25 May 2007 at Celebration IV and was released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Nintendo DS on 6 November 2007 in North America. The game was later released on Microsoft Windows on 13 October 2009, macOS on 12 November 2010, iOS on 11 December 2013, and for Android on 1 January 2015.[1][2] The game was a critical and commercial success.</p>

<h2><u>Gameplay:</u></h2>

<p>The objective of the game is to successfully progress through each episode while collecting Gold Bricks. The Complete Saga spans the events that take place from the Trade Federation negotiations above Naboo in Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) to the Rebel attack on the second Death Star above Endor in Return of the Jedi (1983).</p>
<p>Like in Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, the hub world takes place in the Mos Eisley Cantina. The Cantina has doors that allow the player to enter the levels for Episodes I-VI, the bonus levels, the Bounty Hunter missions, and the Arcade games. The Cantina features a character customizer, a key feature from Lego Star Wars II.</p>

<p>In all versions of the game except for the Nintendo DS version, there are 160 gold bricks to collect; 120 of these are for the main levels. There are three for each of the levels. One is for completing the level in story mode, the second is for achieving "True Jedi" status by collecting a certain amount of studs/coins, and the third is by collecting 10 LEGO "minikit" canisters, which are hidden across the level. For iOS, there are 200 Gold Bricks overall with an additional gold brick available for each level with the completion of a challenge mode where the player must find the 10 hidden blue Minikits in 20 minutes. The iOS version also offers 12 gold bricks by completing the arcade games in the lobby.</p>

<h2><u>Development:</u></h2>
<img src="starwars3.jpg">
<p>Traveller's Tales created The Complete Saga in response to the success of the original game and its sequel with LucasArts publishing the game. They combined the two games while also updating graphics, as well as adding new levels, characters, and new costume elements for customizable characters.[5]</p>
<p>While The Complete Saga targeted major seventh-generation platforms, Traveller's Tales ruled out the possibility of a PlayStation Portable version on the grounds that the developers did not have enough resources to make it.[6]</p>
